# Development Plan for Phase 2: Database & Caching Implementation

## Development Plan Issue

### Overview

Phase 2 focuses on implementing the data persistence and caching layers for the Currency Conversion Service. This includes setting up MongoDB for user data and request logs, implementing Redis for caching and rate limiting, and creating the necessary data access patterns to interact with these services.

### Planned Work

- [ ] Task 1: Set up MongoDB connection and schemas
  - Description: Establish connection to MongoDB, define Mongoose/TypeORM schemas for users and request logs
  - Dependencies: Phase 1 (Project Setup & Core Infrastructure)
  - Estimated effort: 2 days
  - Acceptance criteria: 
    - MongoDB connection is established with proper error handling
    - User schema matches requirements from development plan
    - Request log schema captures all necessary fields
    - Database operations are properly typed
    - Connection pooling is configured for optimal performance

- [ ] Task 2: Implement Redis connection and caching logic
  - Description: Set up Redis client, implement basic caching mechanisms and key management
  - Dependencies: Phase 1
  - Estimated effort: 2 days
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Redis connection is established with proper error handling
    - Cache operations (get, set, expire) are implemented
    - TTL (Time to Live) management is in place
    - Connection pooling is configured for optimal performance
    - Graceful degradation when Redis is unavailable

- [ ] Task 3: Create data access layer for users and logs
  - Description: Implement repository/service pattern for database access
  - Dependencies: MongoDB connection and schemas
  - Estimated effort: 2 days
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - User repository implements CRUD operations
    - Request log repository implements query and create operations
    - Data access is abstracted behind interfaces
    - Type safety is ensured throughout the data layer
    - Unit tests verify correct behavior

- [ ] Task 4: Implement exchange rate caching strategy
  - Description: Develop caching strategy for exchange rates with proper invalidation
  - Dependencies: Redis connection implementation
  - Estimated effort: 2 days
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Exchange rates are cached with 10-minute TTL
    - Cache key structure follows the specified format
    - Cache refresh logic is implemented
    - Stale-while-revalidate pattern implemented for performance
    - Metrics for cache hit/miss rates are available

- [ ] Task 5: Add request logging functionality
  - Description: Implement middleware for logging API requests to MongoDB
  - Dependencies: Data access layer for logs
  - Estimated effort: 1 day
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - All API requests are logged to MongoDB
    - Logged information includes user, currencies, amounts, timestamp
    - Logging is non-blocking (doesn't affect response time)
    - Error handling ensures failed logging doesn't break the API
    - Sensitive information is properly handled

### Implementation Plan

1. [ ] Step 1: Database connection and schema setup
   - Technical approach: Use Mongoose/TypeORM to create connection pools and define schemas
   - Potential challenges: Schema design for optimal query performance
   - Mitigation strategies: Use indexes for frequently queried fields, implement pagination for logs

2. [ ] Step 2: Redis implementation and caching strategy
   - Technical approach: Use ioredis/redis-om for Redis operations, implement caching layer with proper abstraction
   - Potential challenges: Handling Redis connection failures gracefully
   - Mitigation strategies: Implement circuit breaker pattern, fallback to direct API calls

3. [ ] Step 3: Data access layer and logging implementation
   - Technical approach: Repository pattern for data access, middleware for request logging
   - Potential challenges: Ensuring performance under high load
   - Mitigation strategies: Batch inserts for logs, use write-behind caching pattern

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests needed:
  - MongoDB connection and model validation
  - Redis caching operations
  - Repository method tests
  - Cache invalidation tests
  - Request logging middleware tests

- Integration tests needed:
  - Database and Redis connection with Docker services
  - End-to-end request logging flow
  - Cache hit/miss scenarios
  - Database query performance

- Performance considerations:
  - Measure cache hit rates
  - Monitor database query performance
  - Ensure non-blocking logging

### Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Database schema documentation
- [ ] Redis caching strategy documentation
- [ ] Data access layer API documentation
- [ ] Environment variable configuration for database connections
- [ ] Logging format and retention policy documentation

### Timeline

- Start date: [After Phase 1 completion]
- Target completion: 1 week from start date
- Dependencies on other issues: Requires successful completion of Phase 1

### Success Criteria

1. [ ] MongoDB successfully stores user and request log data
2. [ ] Redis caches exchange rates with proper TTL
3. [ ] Data access layer provides clean API for database operations
4. [ ] All API requests are properly logged
5. [ ] System degrades gracefully when Redis is unavailable
6. [ ] All tests pass successfully

### Additional Context

Phase 2 establishes the data foundation for the application. The caching strategy will be critical for meeting the sub-500ms response time requirement for 95% of requests. The database schema and access patterns established here will be used throughout the remainder of the project.
