# Development Plan for Phase 3: Core Business Logic

## Development Plan Issue

### Overview

Phase 3 implements the core business logic of the Currency Conversion Service, focusing on integrating with Coinbase API, implementing currency conversion functionality, adding rate limiting, setting up authentication, and implementing request validation.

### Planned Work

- [ ] Task 1: Implement currency conversion logic
  - Description: Create the core logic for converting between currencies with proper precision handling
  - Dependencies: Phase 2 (Database & Caching Implementation)
  - Estimated effort: 2 days
  - Acceptance criteria: 
    - Currency conversion functions correctly convert BTC to USD
    - Decimal precision is handled appropriately
    - Edge cases (very large/small amounts) are handled properly
    - Error cases for unsupported currency pairs are handled

- [ ] Task 2: Integrate Coinbase API
  - Description: Implement the integration with Coinbase API for real-time exchange rates
  - Dependencies: Currency conversion logic, Redis caching
  - Estimated effort: 2 days
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Coinbase API client is implemented with proper error handling
    - Exchange rates are retrieved successfully
    - API limitations are respected
    - Integration with Redis caching is working
    - Fallback mechanisms for API downtime are in place
    - Coinbase api url is injected via an environment variable

- [ ] Task 3: Add rate limiting middleware
  - Description: Implement rate limiting based on day of week and user identity
  - Dependencies: Redis implementation, Authentication system
  - Estimated effort: 2 days
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Weekday limit (100 requests) is enforced
    - Weekend limit (200 requests) is enforced
    - Limits reset at midnight UTC
    - 429 HTTP responses are returned when limits are exceeded
    - Rate limiting data is stored in Redis

- [ ] Task 4: Implement authentication system
  - Description: Create a Bearer token authentication system for API access
  - Dependencies: User data access layer
  - Estimated effort: 2 days
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Bearer token authentication middleware is implemented
    - 401 responses for missing/invalid tokens
    - User identification is extracted from token
    - Token verification is secure and performant
    - Auth information is available for rate limiting and logging

- [ ] Task 5: Add request validation
  - Description: Implement comprehensive input validation for API requests
  - Dependencies: Express server setup
  - Estimated effort: 1 day
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - All API inputs are validated (currency pairs, amounts)
    - Appropriate error responses for invalid inputs
    - Validation logic is reusable across endpoints
    - Schema validation is type-safe

### Implementation Plan

1. [ ] Step 1: Currency conversion and Coinbase integration
   - Technical approach: Create a service layer for currency conversion with Coinbase API client
   - Potential challenges: Coinbase API rate limits and response handling
   - Mitigation strategies: Implement retry logic, proper error handling, and monitoring

2. [ ] Step 2: Authentication and rate limiting
   - Technical approach: Use middleware for authentication and rate limiting with Redis backing store
   - Potential challenges: Accurately tracking rate limits across distributed systems
   - Mitigation strategies: Use Redis atomic operations, ensure proper key design for rate limits

3. [ ] Step 3: Request validation and error handling integration
   - Technical approach: Implement validation middleware with schema validation
   - Potential challenges: Balancing validation thoroughness with performance
   - Mitigation strategies: Use efficient validation libraries, precompiled schemas

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests needed:
  - Currency conversion logic tests with various amounts
  - Coinbase API client tests (mocked)
  - Rate limiting algorithm tests
  - Authentication middleware tests
  - Validation logic tests

- Integration tests needed:
  - End-to-end API flow with authentication
  - Rate limiting behavior across requests
  - Coinbase API integration (with sandbox environment)

- Performance considerations:
  - Minimize validation overhead
  - Optimize rate limiting checks
  - Ensure authentication is efficient

### Documentation Requirements

- [ ] API endpoint documentation
- [ ] Authentication requirements documentation
- [ ] Rate limiting rules documentation
- [ ] Coinbase API integration details
- [ ] Input validation rules

### Timeline

- Start date: [After Phase 2 completion]
- Target completion: 1 week from start date
- Dependencies on other issues: Requires successful completion of Phase 2

### Success Criteria

1. [ ] Currency conversion accurately converts BTC to USD
2. [ ] Coinbase API integration provides real-time exchange rates
3. [ ] Rate limiting correctly enforces daily limits based on weekday/weekend
4. [ ] Authentication system properly verifies and identifies users
5. [ ] All API inputs are validated with appropriate error messages
6. [ ] All tests pass successfully

### Additional Context

Phase 3 implements the core business logic that defines the application's main functionality. The integration with Coinbase, rate limiting implementation, and authentication system are critical components that directly impact the API's reliability and security.
