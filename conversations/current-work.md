# Development Plan for Phase 4: Testing Implementation

## Development Plan Issue

### Overview

Phase 4 focuses on implementing comprehensive testing for the Currency Conversion Service, including unit tests, integration tests, and load tests. This phase ensures the application meets its quality, reliability, and performance requirements.

### Planned Work

- [ ] Task 1: Set up Bun test runner

  - Description: Configure testing framework and utilities for API testing
  - Dependencies: Phase 3 (Core Business Logic)
  - Estimated effort: 1 day
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Bun test runner
    - Test utilities and helpers are implemented
    - Test database and Redis setup/teardown logic is in place
    - Test coverage reporting is configured

- [ ] Task 2: Implement unit tests

  - Description: Create comprehensive unit tests for all core components
  - Dependencies: Testing framework setup
  - Estimated effort: 3 days
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Exchange rate calculation tests are implemented
    - Redis caching logic tests are implemented
    - Rate limiting enforcement tests are implemented
    - MongoDB request logging tests are implemented
    - Authentication handling tests are implemented
    - All tests pass consistently

- [ ] Task 3: Implement integration tests

  - Description: Create integration tests for full API flows and component interactions
  - Dependencies: Unit test implementation
  - Estimated effort: 3 days
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Full currency conversion flow tests are implemented
    - API resilience and failure handling tests are implemented
    - Rate limiting behavior tests are implemented
    - Docker environment tests are implemented
    - All integration tests pass consistently

- [ ] Task 4: Implement load tests using Artillery
  - Description: Set up performance and load testing to verify system behavior under stress
  - Dependencies: Integration test implementation
  - Estimated effort: 2 days
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Artillery is configured for load testing
    - High-volume traffic scenarios are defined
    - Response time verification tests are implemented
    - Redis caching efficiency tests are implemented
    - Edge case handling under load is tested
    - System meets performance requirements (500ms for 95% of requests)

### Implementation Plan

1. [ ] Step 1: Testing framework setup and unit tests

   - Technical approach: Configure Bun test runner, implement mocks and test utilities
   - Potential challenges: Mocking external dependencies like Coinbase API
   - Mitigation strategies: Create comprehensive mock implementations, use dependency injection

2. [ ] Step 2: Integration and load testing
   - Technical approach: Use Artillery for load testing, Bun test runner's fetch and other components to test api endpoints
   - Potential challenges: Creating realistic test scenarios, avoiding test flakiness
   - Mitigation strategies: Use Docker for isolated testing environment, implement retry logic for flaky tests

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests needed:

  - All service layer functions
  - Middleware components
  - API controllers
  - Database repositories
  - Utility functions

- Integration tests needed:

  - API endpoint tests with database and Redis integration
  - Authentication and rate limiting integration
  - Error scenarios and edge cases

- Performance considerations:
  - Test execution speed optimization
  - Realistic performance test scenarios
  - Measuring cache hit rates during tests

### Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Testing strategy documentation
- [ ] Test coverage reports
- [ ] Load testing results documentation
- [ ] CI/CD test integration documentation
- [ ] Test execution instructions

### Timeline

- Start date: [After Phase 3 completion]
- Target completion: 1 week from start date
- Dependencies on other issues: Requires successful completion of Phase 3

### Success Criteria

1. [ ] Unit test coverage meets target threshold (>80%)
2. [ ] All integration tests pass consistently
3. [ ] Load tests demonstrate system meets performance requirements
4. [ ] Edge cases and failure scenarios are thoroughly tested
5. [ ] Tests are integrated into CI/CD pipeline

### Additional Context

Phase 4 ensures the reliability and quality of the Currency Conversion Service. The comprehensive testing strategy implemented in this phase will help identify and resolve issues before they impact users, and validate that the system meets its performance requirements.
