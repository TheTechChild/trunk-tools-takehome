# Development Plan for Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Infrastructure

Based on our development plan, here's a structured plan for Phase 1 implementation using the development plan issue template format:

## Development Plan Issue

### Overview

Phase 1 focuses on establishing the core infrastructure for the Currency Conversion Service, including TypeScript setup, Express server configuration, Docker environment setup, error handling implementation, and development environment configuration with hot reloading.

### Planned Work

- [ ] Task 1: Initialize project with TypeScript

  - Description: Set up TypeScript configuration with proper compiler options, type definitions, and directory structure
  - Dependencies: None (Phase 0 has been completed)
  - Estimated effort: 1 day
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - TypeScript configuration is in place with appropriate settings for a Node.js/Express project
    - Project structure follows best practices with clear separation of concerns
    - Type definitions for all external libraries are installed

- [ ] Task 2: Set up Express server with basic routing

  - Description: Create an Express application with route structure and middleware configuration
  - Dependencies: TypeScript setup
  - Estimated effort: 2 days
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Express server starts and listens on configured port
    - Basic routing structure is implemented following REST principles
    - Health check endpoint is available
    - Middleware for request parsing and validation is configured

- [ ] Task 3: Configure Docker environment

  - Description: Create Docker and docker-compose configurations for development and production
  - Dependencies: Express server setup
  - Estimated effort: 2 days
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Dockerfile optimized for Node.js applications with proper layering
    - Docker compose setup for the application, MongoDB, and Redis services
    - Environment variables configured correctly
    - Volumes set up for data persistence
    - Network configuration allows services to communicate

- [ ] Task 4: Implement basic error handling

  - Description: Create a robust error handling system that captures and formats errors appropriately
  - Dependencies: Express server setup
  - Estimated effort: 1 day
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Custom error classes defined for different error types
    - Global error handling middleware implemented
    - Errors are formatted consistently in API responses
    - Error logging is configured

- [ ] Task 5: Set up development environment with hot reloading
  - Description: Configure development tooling for efficient development workflow
  - Dependencies: Docker environment, Express server
  - Estimated effort: 1 day
  - Acceptance criteria:
    - Hot reloading is configured to automatically restart server on code changes
    - Development mode provides helpful debugging information
    - Development tools (like nodemon or Bun's watch mode) are properly configured
    - Debugging configuration is available

### Implementation Plan

1. [ ] Step 1: Initialize TypeScript project and configure Express

   - Technical approach: Use Bun to initialize the project with TypeScript support, configure tsconfig.json for Node.js, set up Express with middleware
   - Potential challenges: Ensuring TypeScript types are correctly set up for all libraries
   - Mitigation strategies: Use @types packages and create custom type definitions when needed

2. [ ] Step 2: Create Docker configuration

   - Technical approach: Create multi-stage Dockerfile for optimized builds, set up docker-compose for services
   - Potential challenges: Managing environment variables across different environments
   - Mitigation strategies: Use .env files for local development and Docker secrets for production

3. [ ] Step 3: Implement error handling and development environment
   - Technical approach: Create error handling middleware, implement custom error classes, set up Bun's watch mode
   - Potential challenges: Ensuring all errors are properly caught and handled
   - Mitigation strategies: Add comprehensive testing for error scenarios

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests needed:

  - Express server initialization tests
  - Route registration tests
  - Error handling middleware tests
  - Configuration loading tests

- Integration tests needed:

  - Basic API health check endpoint
  - Docker container startup and communication

- Performance considerations:
  - Ensure fast startup time for development environment
  - Optimize Docker build time and image size

### Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Project structure documentation
- [ ] Setup instructions for local development
- [ ] Docker environment documentation
- [ ] API endpoint documentation (initial structure)

### Timeline

- Start date: [Current date]
- Target completion: 1 week from start date
- Dependencies on other issues: None (follows completion of Phase 0)

### Success Criteria

1. [ ] Developer can run `bun run dev` and server starts with hot reloading
2. [ ] Docker containers for app, MongoDB, and Redis start successfully with `docker-compose up`
3. [ ] Basic API endpoints return appropriate responses
4. [ ] Server handles errors gracefully with appropriate HTTP status codes
5. [ ] All planned tests pass successfully

### Additional Context

This phase establishes the foundation for all subsequent development. It's crucial to get these elements right as they will be built upon in later phases. The TypeScript configuration, Express setup, and Docker environment will be used throughout the project.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to this development plan or would you like to proceed with creating an issue based on this template?
