## Core Features & Requirements

### 1. Currency Conversion

- Real-time conversion using Coinbase API
- Support for BTC â†’ USD conversions
- Proper decimal precision handling
- Error handling for unsupported currency pairs
- Response time target: <500ms for 95% of requests

### 2. Data Storage (MongoDB)

#### Users Collection Schema

```json
{
  "_id": "dab458d6-8352-42e6-88a1-88acc76b4e43",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "created_at": "2025-03-27T10:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Request Logs Collection Schema

```json
{
  "_id": "some-object-id",
  "user_id": "dab458d6-8352-42e6-88a1-88acc76b4e43",
  "from_currency": "BTC",
  "to_currency": "USD",
  "amount": 999.2,
  "converted_amount": 67890.12,
  "exchange_rate": 67.89,
  "timestamp": "2025-03-27T14:52:00Z"
}
```

### 3. Redis Caching

- Cache exchange rates for 10 minutes
- Key structure: `{ "BTC-USD": { "exchange_rate": 67890.12, "timestamp": "2025-03-27T14:50:00Z" } }`
- Fallback to Coinbase API when cache is stale
- Graceful degradation if Redis is unavailable

### 4. Rate Limiting

- 100 requests per weekday (Monday-Friday) per user
- 200 requests per weekend day (Saturday-Sunday) per user
- HTTP 429 response when limits exceeded
- Daily reset at midnight UTC
- Implemented using Redis

### 5. Authentication
